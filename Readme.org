These sources package [[http://clocc.sourceforge.net/dist/port.html][PORT]], which is part of [[http://clocc.sourceforge.net/][CLOCC]] as a library for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMusic][OpenMusic]] and also  [[http://www2.siba.fi/PWGL/][PWGL]], so that PORT can be easily loaded into OpenMusic and PWGL.

PORT provides a platform-independent interface to various features absent from the ANSI Common Lisp standard, such as sockets, shell, Gray streams etc. The implementation-specific things, like loads of #+/#-, are hidden from the user.

This package does not define any graphical boxes for OpenMusic nor for PWGL.

The original CLOCC sources of PORT do not support ASDF, which is required by PWGL. Instead, the present sources stem from the debian cl-port package: cl-port_20060408.orig.tar.gz and cl-port_20060408-1.diff.gz (see http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/cl-port), and have been created by 

  cd cl-port-20060408.orig
  patch -p1 < ../cl-port_20060408-1.diff
